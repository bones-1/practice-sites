# Practice Webpages
This repo contains some websites that I recreated to improve upon my coding proficiency.

## About this Project
This is a compilation of websites that I have copied on my ongoing journey to becoming a Fullstack Developer. The websites contained within, have been recreated using my own methods; so this means that when you take a look at the source codes, they will be different from the original's (though certain assets will be replicated, to make my version resemble the original's as closely as possible - such as fonts, images, icons, etc).

### Motivation
The purpose behind recreating these sites is to brush up on what I already know, as well as to employ additional skills that I have come across.

### Contributions
While I am always open to receiving an helping hand, this particular project is meant to showcase my journey, and as such, I respectfully decline contributions at this point in time. However, I welcome and encourage your feedback.

## Disclaimer
NOTE: I am not the original author, designer, owner of the works held inside this folder, nor am I affiliated with owner of any of these websites. I am simply recreating their likeness for practice purposes only.

## Deployment
If you would like to download and preview any of the pages from this folder locally, there are a few packages that you will need:

* [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
* [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) - yarn/npm will do as well.

Other dependencies will be downloaded automatically by pnpm from the package.json file.

```bash
  # Make a local clone of the repo.
  cd folder/to/clone-into/;
  git clone https://github.com/bones-1/practice-sites;

  # Enter downloaded repo directory and see options.
  cd practice-sites/ && ls;

  # Choose site to view and enter directory.
  cd countryliving.com/;

  # Use pnpm/yarn/npm to download dependencies needed to pre-process files and start live server.
  pnpm i;

  # Pre-process files and start live server.
  pnpm run dev;

  # Copy and paste http://localhost:1234 into your browser and hit enter.
